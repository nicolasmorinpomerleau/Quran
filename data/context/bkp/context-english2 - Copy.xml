		<aya index="2" text="We have not sent down the Qur'an to you that you should be burdened,"/>
		<aya index="3" text="But as admonition for him who fears --"/>
		<aya index="4" text="A revelation from Him who created the earth and the high ascending skies,"/>
		<aya index="5" text="The ever-merciful, established on the throne (of authority)."/>
		<aya index="6" text="Whatever is in the heavens and the earth and in between them, belongs to Him, as whatever lies under the earth."/>
		<aya index="7" text="Whether you say a thing aloud or inaudibly, He has knowledge of the secret and the hidden."/>
		<aya index="8" text="God: There is no god but He. To Him belong the attributes most beautiful."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Has the story of Moses come to you?"/>
		<aya index="10" text="When he saw a fire he said to his family: &quot;You wait here. I have seen a fire. I may haply be able to bring an ember from it, or find direction by the fire.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="11" text="When he approached it, a voice called out:"/>
		<aya index="12" text="&quot;O Moses, I am verily your Lord, so take off your shoes, for you are in the holy plain of Towa."/>
		<aya index="13" text="I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed to you."/>
		<aya index="14" text="I am God, and there is no god but I, so serve Me, and observe acts of prayer to remember Me."/>
		<aya index="15" text="Verily the Hour (of the great change) is about to come. I keep it secret that every soul may be rewarded for its endeavour."/>
		<aya index="16" text="So do not let those who do not believe in it and follow their vain desires, turn you away from it."/>
		<aya index="17" text="What is that in your right band, O Moses?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="18" text="&quot;It's my staff,&quot; he answered; &quot;I lean on it, and fell leaves for my goats with it, and I have other uses for it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="&quot;Throw it down, O Moses,&quot; said (the Voice)."/>
		<aya index="20" text="So he threw it down, and lo, it became a running serpent."/>
		<aya index="21" text="&quot;Catch it,&quot; said He, &quot;and have no fear; We shall revert it to its former state."/>
		<aya index="22" text="And face what is to come with patience, your hand will not be tarnished with blame: Another sign"/>
		<aya index="23" text="That We may go on showing you Our greater signs."/>
		<aya index="24" text="Go to the Pharaoh as he has become exceedingly rebellious.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Moses said: &quot;O my Lord, enlarge my breast,"/>
		<aya index="26" text="And make my mission easy."/>
		<aya index="27" text="Remove the defect of my tongue"/>
		<aya index="28" text="That they may understand my speech,"/>
		<aya index="29" text="And give me as assistant from my family"/>
		<aya index="30" text="Aaron my brother"/>

		<aya index="34" text="And remember you a great deal."/>
		<aya index="35" text="Surely You know us well.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="He answered: &quot;Granted is your prayer, O Moses."/>
		<aya index="37" text="We have bestowed Our favour on you before this"/>
		<aya index="38" text="When We told your mother what We relate:"/>
		<aya index="39" text="'Put him in a wooden box and cast it in the river. The river will cast it on the bank. An enemy of Ours, and his, will retrieve it.' We bestowed Our love on you that you may be reared under Our eyes."/>
		<aya index="40" text="Then your sister followed you, and said (to the people who had retrieved the child): 'Should I guide you to a person who can nurse him?' We thus brought you back to your mother that her heart may be cheered, and she may not grieve. (Remember) when you killed a man We saved you from anguish; and tested and steeled you (in other ways). Afterwards you sojourned for several years with the people of Midian; then you came up to the measure,"/>
		<aya index="41" text="And I chose you for Myself."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Go with My signs, you and your brother, and do not be lax in remembering Me."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Then go to the Pharaoh as he has become exceedingly rebellious."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Speak to him gently. He may possibly take heed or may come to have fear.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="They said: &quot;O our Lord, we are really frightened lest he behave insolently with us or become violent.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="46" text="(The Lord) said: &quot;Be not afraid. I am verily with you, and I hear and see."/>
		<aya index="47" text="So go to him and say: 'The two of us have indeed been sent by your Lord. So let the children of Israel come with us, and do not oppress them. We have come to you with a token from your Lord. Peace on him who follows the way of guidance."/>
		<aya index="48" text="It has been revealed to us that punishment will befall him who denies and turns away."/>
		<aya index="49" text="He asked: &quot;Who then is that Lord of yours, O Moses?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="(Moses) said: &quot;Our Lord is He who gave everything its natural form and directed it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="51" text="(The Pharaoh) said: &quot;And what about the former generations?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="52" text="(Moses) replied: &quot;Knowledge of that is with my Lord (recorded) in the Book. My Lord neither errs nor forgets.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="It is He who made the earth a bed for you, and traced for you paths upon it, and sends down water from the sky, and brings out through it every kind of vegetation"/>
		<aya index="54" text="To eat and feed your cattle. Surely there are signs in these for those who are wise."/>
		<aya index="55" text="We created you from the earth and will revert you back to it; and raise you up from it a second time."/>
		<aya index="56" text="So We showed him all Our signs, but he denied them and refused,"/>
		<aya index="57" text="And said: &quot;Have you come to us, O Moses, to drive us out of our land with your witchery?"/>
		<aya index="58" text="We shall certainly meet you with like magic. So make an appointment when we and you could meet on common ground, which neither we nor you should fail to keep.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="59" text="Said (Moses): &quot;Let your meeting be on the day of the Feast, and let people assemble in broad daylight.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="60" text="After this the Pharaoh withdrew and settled his stratagem, then came back."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Moses said to them: &quot;Woe betide you. Do not fabricate a lie against God, or He will destroy you with some affliction. For he who fabricates lies is doomed to failure.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="So they discussed their strategy among themselves and conferred privately,"/>
		<aya index="63" text="(And) said: &quot;These two are surely magicians. They want to deprive you of your land with their magic, and eradicate your distinct way (of life)."/>
		<aya index="64" text="So prepare your strategy and come forward. He alone shall win today who is superior.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="They said: &quot;Either you cast (your spell), O Moses, or we shall cast it first.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Moses said: &quot;No. You cast it first&quot; Then it seemed to Moses that by their magic their cords and rods were flying;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="And Moses felt afraid within himself."/>
		<aya index="68" text="We said to him: &quot;Fear not. You will certainly be victorious."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Throw down what is in your right hand: It will swallow up what they have conjured. For what they have fashioned is only a trick of the sorcerer; and a sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may come.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="The magicians, (seeing the miracle), fell down in prostration, saying: &quot;We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="(The Pharaoh) said: &quot;You have come to believe without my dispensation. Surely he is your chief who taught you magic. I will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunks of date-palm trees. You will come to know whose punishment is harder and protracted.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="They replied: &quot;We cannot choose you in the face of the clear testimony we have received, and over Him who created us. So do what you are determined to do. All that you would do will only be confined to our life on earth."/>
		<aya index="73" text="We have certainly come to believe in our Lord that He may forgive our trespasses and the magic you have forced us to perform, for God is nobler and abiding.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="Surely for him who comes before his Lord a sinner shall be Hell, where he will neither die nor live."/>
		<aya index="75" text="But whoever comes before Him a believer having done good deeds, will be raised to higher stations --"/>
		<aya index="76" text="Gardens of Eden with rippling streams, where he will live for ever. This is the recompense of those who achieve integrity."/>
		<aya index="77" text="We commanded Moses: &quot;Journey by night with Our creatures, and strike a dry path for them through the sea. Do not fear being overtaken, nor have dread of any thing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="Then the Pharaoh followed them with his army, but the sea overpowered and engulfed them."/>
		<aya index="79" text="The Pharaoh had led his people astray, and did not rightly guide them."/>
		<aya index="80" text="O children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount, and sent down for you manna and quails,"/>
		<aya index="81" text="(And said): &quot;Eat of the good things We have given you for food, and do not exceed the bounds (of law) in this, or My wrath will surely fall upon you; and he who incurs My wrath will fall into the abyss."/>
		<aya index="82" text="Yet I am gracious to him who repents and believes, and does the right, and follows the straight path."/>
		<aya index="83" text="What made you hurry away, O Moses, from your people?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="84" text="He said: &quot;They are right behind me. I have hastened to You, O Lord, so that You may be pleased.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="85" text="He said: &quot;We have put your people on trial in your absence; and Sameri has led them astray.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="86" text="So Moses returned to his people full of anger and regret. &quot;O my people,&quot; he said, &quot;did not your Lord make you a better promise? Did the time of covenant seem too long to you? Or did you wish the wrath of your Lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They said: &quot;We did not break our promise to you of our own will, but we were made to carry the loads of ornaments belonging to the people, which we threw (into the fire), and so did Sameri."/>
		<aya index="88" text="Then he produced the image of a calf which mooed like a cow. And they said: 'This is your god and the god of Moses (whom) he has neglected.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="89" text="Did they not see that it did not give them any answer, nor had it power to do them harm or bring them gain?"/>
		<aya index="90" text="Aaron had indeed told them earlier: &quot;O my people, you are being only misled with this. Surely your Lord is Ar-Rahman. So follow me and obey my command.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said &quot;So long as Moses does not come back we are not going to give it up, and we will remain devoted to it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="92" text="But (Moses) said: &quot;O Aaron, when you saw that they had gone astray, what hindered you"/>
		<aya index="93" text="From coming after me? Did you not disobey my command?&quot; (And Moses pulled him by the hair)."/>
		<aya index="94" text="&quot;O son of my mother,&quot; (Aaron cried), do not pull me by my beard or my hair! I was really afraid you may say that I had created a rift among the children of Israel, and did not pay heed to your command.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="Moses asked: &quot;O Sameri, what was the matter?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="96" text="He said: &quot;I saw what they did not see. I picked up a handful of dust from the messenger's tracks and threw it in, for the idea seemed attractive to me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="97" text="(Moses) said: &quot;Go hence! All your life you are (cursed) to say: 'Do not touch me; and a threat hangs over you which you will not be able to escape. Look at your god to whom you are so attached: We shall verily burn it, and disperse its ashes into the sea."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Your god is only God. There is no other god but He. His knowledge extends over everything.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Thus do We narrate some account to you of what has gone before, and We have truly given you a Reminder of Our own."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Whoever turns away from it will surely carry a burden on the Day of Judgement,"/>
		<aya index="101" text="And will live for ever under it. How evil the burden they will carry on the Day of Doom!"/>
		<aya index="102" text="The day the trumpet blast is sounded We shall raise the sinners blind,"/>
		<aya index="103" text="Whispering to one another: &quot;You have tarried but ten days.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="104" text="We know well what they will say when the most upright among them will say: &quot;You did not tarry more than a day.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="105" text="They will ask you about the mountains. Tell them: &quot;My Lord will uproot them from the base,"/>
		<aya index="106" text="And turn them into a level plain,"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Over which you will see no curves or elevations."/>
		<aya index="108" text="That day they will follow the summoner from whom there will be no receding; and their voices will be hushed before Ar-Rahman, and you will not hear a sound but faint shuffling."/>
		<aya index="109" text="On that day no intercession will matter other than his whom Ar-Rahman grants permission and accepts."/>
		<aya index="110" text="He knows what is before them and hidden from them, but they cannot grasp it with their knowledge."/>
		<aya index="111" text="All heads will be bowed before the Living, the Eternal; and whosoever bears a load of iniquity will be full of despair."/>
		<aya index="112" text="But he who has done good things and believes, will have no fear of either being wronged or deprived."/>
		<aya index="113" text="That is why We have sent it down as an eloquent Qur'an, and explained in different ways the intimidations through it that they may haply take heed, or perhaps it may lead them to contemplate."/>
		<aya index="114" text="Exalted then be God, the real King; and do not try to anticipate the Qur'an before the completion of its revelation, but pray: &quot;O Lord, give me greater knowledge.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="115" text="We had commanded Adam before, but he disregarded it: We found him lacking in resolution."/>
		<aya index="116" text="When We said to the angels: ''Bow before Adam,'' they all bowed but Iblis, who refused."/>
		<aya index="117" text="So We said; &quot;O Adam, he is truly your enemy and your wife's. Do not let him have you turned out of Paradise and come to grief."/>
		<aya index="118" text="Verily you will have no hunger or nakedness there,"/>
		<aya index="119" text="Nor thirst nor exposure to the sun.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="120" text="But then Satan tempted him by saying: &quot;O Adam, should I show you the tree of immortality, and a kingdom that will never know any wane?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="121" text="And both ate of (its fruit), and their hidden parts were exposed to one another, and they patched the leaves of the garden (to hide them). Adam disobeyed his Lord, and went astray."/>
		<aya index="122" text="Then his Lord chose him and relented towards him, and showed him the way;"/>
		<aya index="123" text="(And) said: &quot;Go down hence together, one the enemy of the other. Then will guidance come to you from Me; and whoever follows My direction will neither be disgraced nor be miserable."/>
		<aya index="124" text="But he who fails to heed My warning will have his means restricted; and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him blind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="125" text="He will ask: &quot;O Lord, why have you raised me blind when I was able to see?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="126" text="(God) will say: &quot;Because Our signs came to you, but you disregarded them. So shall We disregard you this day.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="127" text="And that is how We requite him who is extravagant and does not believe the signs of his Lord; and surely the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and persistent."/>
		<aya index="128" text="Did they not learn from the many generations that We destroyed before them, whose habitations they now frequent? Verily there are signs in this for men of understanding."/>
		<aya index="129" text="If the decree (of respite) had not been pronounced by your Lord, (the inevitable judgement would have ensued); but a term is fixed (for everything)."/>
		<aya index="130" text="So you bear with patience what they say, and sing the praises of your Lord before the rising and setting of the sun, and honour Him in the watches of the night, and then at the two ends of day, that you may find acceptance."/>
		<aya index="131" text="Do not covet what We have granted myriads of people of the pomp and glitter of this world to tempt them. The means your Lord has given you are better far and more enduring."/>
		<aya index="132" text="Enjoin on your people service to God, and be yourself constant in it. We do not ask you to provide: It is We who provide for you. The reward is for piety and fear of God."/>
		<aya index="133" text="Yet they say: &quot;Why does he not bring a sign from his Lord?&quot; Have not clear proofs come to them in what is contained in the earlier Books?"/>
		<aya index="134" text="If We had destroyed them by some calamity sooner than this, they would have surely said: &quot;O Lord, if You had sent to us a messenger we would have followed Your command before being humbled and disgraced.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="135" text="Say: &quot;Each one awaits the consequence; so you wait. You will come to know soon who are the men of the straight path and who have come to guidance."/>

		<aya index="5" text="Yet they say: &quot;These are only confused dreams,&quot; or rather: &quot;He has invented them;&quot; or: &quot;He is only a poet. Let him therefore bring a miracle to us as the earlier (apostles) were sent with.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="6" text="Not one habitation that We destroyed before them had believed. So how can they believe?"/>
		<aya index="7" text="Never did We send a message before you but through a man, whom We inspired. If you do not know, then ask the keepers of the oracles of God."/>
		<aya index="8" text="We did not make their bodies immune to hunger, nor were they immortal."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Then We made Our promise good to them and delivered whomsoever We pleased, and destroyed the transgressors."/>

		<aya index="30" text="Do not these unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were an integrated mass, then We split them and made every living thing from water? Will they not believe even then?"/>
		<aya index="31" text="We placed stabilisers in the earth so that as it revolved with them you lived undisturbed; and We provided passageways between them so that men may find their way;"/>

		<aya index="3" text="We narrate to you from the history of Moses and Pharaoh in all verity, for those who believe."/>
		<aya index="4" text="The Pharaoh had become high and mighty in the land, and divided the people into different classes, and impoverished one class, slaying its males and sparing its women, for he was indeed a tyrant."/>
		<aya index="5" text="We wished to favour those who were weak in the land and make them leaders and heirs,"/>
		<aya index="6" text="And establish them in the country; and to make the Pharaoh, Haman and their hordes beware of what they feared from them."/>
		<aya index="7" text="So We conveyed to the mother of Moses: &quot;Suckle him. If you are afraid for him, cast him in the river without any fear or regret, for We shall restore him to you, and make him an apostle.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="8" text="Then he was picked up by the family of Pharaoh (unaware) that he would become their enemy and a cause for regret. Surely the Pharaoh, Haman and their hordes were habitual sinners."/>
		<aya index="9" text="The Pharaoh's wife said: &quot;He will be a comfort to me and to you. Do not kill him. He may well be of some advantage to us, or we may adopt him as a son.&quot; They were not aware (of what the future held in store)."/>
		<aya index="10" text="The mother of Moses was perturbed in the morning. Had We not strengthened her heart to remain a believer she had almost given him away."/>
		<aya index="11" text="She told his sister: &quot;Follow him.&quot; So she kept an eye on him from a distance, unbeknown to them."/>
		<aya index="12" text="We made (Moses) refuse a wet nurse. So his sister said: &quot;Should I tell you of a household that could bring him up for you and take care of him?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="Thus We restored him to his mother that she may be tranquil and not grieve, and know that the promise of God is true, though most men do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When he had grown up to full maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We recompense the doers of good."/>
		<aya index="15" text="He came to the city when the people were in a care-free mood, and saw two men quarrelling, one belonging to his community, the other to his enemies. The man who belonged to his community appealed for help against the one who belonged to the enemies. Moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off. &quot;This is of Satan's doing,&quot; he said. &quot;He is certainly an enemy and a corrupter.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="16" text="&quot;O Lord,&quot; he prayed, &quot;I have done wrong, forgive me.&quot; And God forgave him. Verily He is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="17" text="(Moses) said: &quot;O Lord, as You have been gracious to me I will never aid the guilty.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="18" text="In the morning he came to the city, fearful and hesitant. Just then he who had asked him for help the day before called out for help (again). &quot;You are indeed a meddlesome fellow,&quot; Moses said to him."/>
		<aya index="19" text="Then as he was about to lay hands on the one who was their common enemy, he cried out: &quot;O Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed that person yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and no peacemaker.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="20" text="There came a man running from the other part of the city. &quot;O Moses,&quot; he said, &quot;the chiefs are deliberating to kill you. Go away from the city. I wish you well.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="21" text="So he left the city, fearful and hesitant, (and) prayed: &quot;O Lord, deliver me from these wicked people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="22" text="Then as he turned his face to Midian, he said: &quot;Maybe my Lord will show me the right way.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="23" text="And when he came to the waters of Midian he found a crowd of people watering (their flocks), and saw two maidens holding back (their cattle). He asked: &quot;What is the trouble with you?&quot; They said: &quot;We cannot water our flock till the shepherds have driven away theirs, and our father is a very old man.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="24" text="So he watered (their flock), and moved into the shade and prayed: &quot;My Lord, I have need of whatever good you send me.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="25" text="Then one of the (maidens) came to him walking bashfully, (and) said: &quot;My father invites you that he may repay you for having watered our flock.&quot; So, when (Moses) came to him and told him his story, he said: &quot;Have no fear. You have escaped from the wicked people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="26" text="Said one of the maidens: &quot;O father, employ him. Surely the best (man) to employ is one who is strong and honest.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="27" text="He said: &quot;I would like to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you if you agree to work for me on hire for eight years. And if you stay on for ten, it is up to you. I do not wish to impose any hardship on you. God willing you will find me a man of honour.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="28" text="(Moses) said: &quot;This is (agreed) between you and me. Whichever term I fulfil, no injustice will be done to me. God is witness to our agreement.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="When Moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family, he noticed a fire on the side of the mountain. &quot;Wait here,&quot; he said to his family; &quot;I have seen a fire. I may haply bring some news from there, or an ember that you may warm yourselves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="When he drew near, a voice called out to him from the tree on the blessed spot on the right side of the valley: &quot;O Moses, I am verily God, the Lord of all the worlds."/>
		<aya index="31" text="Throw down your staff.&quot; When he saw it wriggling like a serpent, he turned about and fled without turning. &quot;O Moses, approach,&quot; (said the Voice), &quot;and have no fear. You will be safe."/>
		<aya index="32" text="Put your hand inside your shirt. It will come out white without a tarnish of blame; and do not be perturbed or afraid. These are two proofs from your Lord for the Pharaoh and his nobles. They are certainly a rebellious people.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="He said: &quot;O Lord, I have killed a man of theirs, and fear they would kill me."/>
		<aya index="34" text="So send my brother Aaron with me as helper for he is more fluent than I with words, that he should affirm me, for I fear that they would call me a liar.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="(And) God said: &quot;We shall strengthen your arm with your brother, and give you power with Our signs and give you authority, so that they will not be able to harm you. Both of you and your followers will be victorious.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs they said: &quot;This is nothing but magic he has contrived, for we have not heard of this from our fathers of old.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="But Moses said: &quot;My Lord knows well who has come with guidance from Him, and for whom is the guerdon of Paradise. But surely the wicked will not prosper.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="The Pharaoh said: &quot;O nobles, I am not aware of any other lord of yours but myself. So, O Haman, fire some clay (bricks) to build a tower for me that I may mount up (and see) the God of Moses; for I think he is a liar.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="He and his soldiers had become arrogant in the land for no reason, and did not think that they have to come back to Us in the end."/>
		<aya index="40" text="So We seized him and his hordes and threw them into the sea. Behold then how was the end of the wicked!"/>
		<aya index="41" text="We made them the leaders of those who call to Hell; and on the Day of Judgement they will not be helped."/>
		<aya index="42" text="A curse lies upon them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be despised."/>
		<aya index="43" text="After We had destroyed the earlier generations We gave Moses the Book as evidence for mankind, and a guidance and grace, so that they may remember."/>
		<aya index="44" text="You were not there on the western side (of Mount Sinai) when We gave the commandments to Moses, nor were you witness (to the event)."/>
		<aya index="45" text="We raised (many more) generations and prolonged their lives. You did not live with the people of Midian, nor recited to them Our revelations; but We kept on sending messengers."/>
		<aya index="46" text="You were not present on the side of Mount Sinai when We called. And all this (knowledge that you are given) is by the grace of your Lord so that you may warn a people to whom no admonisher had come before you, that they may take heed;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="And in case disaster comes upon them for what they have done themselves, they should say: &quot;O Lord, why did You not send an apostle to us that we should have followed Your commands, and been with those who are believers;&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="But when the truth came to them from Us, they said: &quot;Why is he not given the like of what was given to Moses?&quot; Did they not disbelieve before in what was given to Moses? They said: &quot;Both are imposters one like the other,&quot; and added: &quot;We do not believe in either.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="Say: &quot;Then bring a Book from God which gives better guidance than these so that I may follow it, if you speak the truth.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="50" text="Then, if they cannot give you an answer, know that they are only following their lusts. And who can be farther astray than he who follows his lust without any guidance from God? And certainly God does not guide an unjust people."/>

		<aya index="57" text="They say: &quot;If we followed your guidance we would be driven from the land by force.&quot; Have We not set up a sanctuary for them, to which is brought a wealth of everything as provision from Us? But most of them do not understand."/>
		<aya index="58" text="How many habitations that had come to boast of their resources have We destroyed? These their dwellings were never inhabited except rarely after them; and they came back to Us."/>
		<aya index="59" text="But your Lord does not destroy habitations without having sent an apostle to their metropolis to read out Our commandments to them. We would never have destroyed cities if their inhabitants were not given to wickedness."/>
		<aya index="60" text="Whatsoever has been given you is the stuff this life is made of, and only its embellishment. What is with your Lord is better and abiding. Will you not understand?"/>
		<aya index="61" text="Can one who was given a better promise, which he will find come true, be like him who was given a little enjoyment of this life, but who will afterwards be brought (to judgement) on the Day of Resurrection?"/>
		<aya index="62" text="That day God will call them and ask: &quot;Where are they you imagined were My compeers?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="Those against whom the sentence is justified will say: &quot;O Lord, these are those we had led astray as we had ourselves gone astray. We clear ourselves before You: They never worshipped us.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="70" text="He is God. There is no god but He. His alone is praise first and last, and His the judgement, and to Him will you be brought back in the end."/>

This puts the Prophet to inconvenience, and he feels embarrassed before you; but God is not embarrassed in (saying) the truth. And when you ask his wife for some thing of utility, ask for it from behind the screen. This is for the purity of your hearts and theirs. It does not behove you to annoy the prophet of God, or to ever marry his wives after him. This would indeed be serious in the sight of God."/>

What the unbelievers have been promising one another is nothing but deceit."/>

So can they expect any thing but what befell the earlier people? You will not find any change in the law of God, nor will you find divine law mutable."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Have they not journeyed in the land and seen how the end of those before them, who were far more powerful, came about? There is nothing in the heavens and the earth that can defeat (the law of) God. He is all-knowing and all-powerful."/>
		<aya index="45" text="If God were to seize men for their doings, not a living being would be left upon the earth. But He gives them respite for a time ordained. When their time is come, surely God will keep (the interest of) His creatures in view."/>
