		<aya index="1" text="ALIF LAM MIM."/>
		<aya index="2" text="This is The Book free of doubt and involution, a guidance for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path,"/>
		<aya index="3" text="Who believe in the Unknown and fulfil their devotional obligations, and spend in charity of what We have given them;"/>
		<aya index="4" text="Who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to those before you, and are certain of the Hereafter."/>
		<aya index="5" text="They have found the guidance of their Lord and will be successful."/>
		<aya index="6" text="As for those who deny, it is all the same if you warn them or not, they will not believe."/>
		<aya index="7" text="God has sealed their hearts and ears, and veiled their eyes. For them is great deprivation."/>
		<aya index="8" text="And there are some who, though they say: &quot;We believe in God and the Last Day,&quot; (in reality) do not believe."/>
		<aya index="9" text="They (try to) deceive God and those who believe, yet deceive none but themselves although they do not know."/>
		<aya index="10" text="Sick are their hearts, and God adds to their malady. For them is suffering for they lie."/>
		<aya index="11" text="When asked to desist from spreading corruption in the land they say: &quot;Why, we are reformers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="12" text="Yet they are surely mischief-mongers, even though they do not know."/>
		<aya index="13" text="When asked to believe as others do, they say: &quot;Should we believe like fools?&quot; And yet they are the fools, even though they do not know."/>
		<aya index="14" text="When they meet the faithful they say: &quot;We believe;&quot; but when alone with the devils (their fellows), they say: &quot;We are really with you; we were joking.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="15" text="But God will turn the joke against them and allow them to sink deeper into evil and wander perplexed in their wickedness."/>
		<aya index="16" text="They are indeed those who bartered away good guidance for error and gained nothing from the deal, nor found the right way."/>
		<aya index="17" text="They are like a man who kindles a fire, and when its glow has illumined the air God takes away their light leaving them in the dark where they will not be able to see."/>
		<aya index="18" text="They are deaf, dumb and blind, and shall never return;"/>
		<aya index="19" text="Or like rain pouring from the sky which hides within it darkness, thunder and lightning. They thrust their fingers into their ears for safety against noise and death. But God surrounds those who believe not from all sides."/>
		<aya index="20" text="Verily the lightning could snatch away their eyes. When it flashes forth they walk in its flare. When darkness returns they stand still. And if the Lord wills so He could take away their hearing and sight; surely God is all-powerful."/>
		<aya index="21" text="So, O you people, adore your Lord who created you, as He did those before you, that you could take heed for yourselves and fear Him"/>
		<aya index="22" text="Who made the earth a bed for you, the sky a canopy, and sends forth rain from the skies that fruits may grow -- your food and sustenance. So, do not make another the equal of God knowingly."/>
		<aya index="23" text="If you are in doubt of what We have revealed to Our votary, then bring a Surah like this, and call any witness, apart from God, you like, if you are truthful."/>
		<aya index="24" text="But if you cannot, as indeed you cannot, then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is men and rocks, which has been prepared for the infidels."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Announce to those who believe and have done good deeds, glad tidings of gardens under which rivers flow, and where, when they eat the fruits that grow, they will say: &quot;Indeed they are the same as we were given before,&quot; so like in semblance the food would be. And they shall have fair spouses there, and live there abidingly."/>
		<aya index="26" text="God is not loath to advance the similitude of a gnat or a being more contemptible; and those who believe know whatever is from the Lord is true. But those who disbelieve say: &quot;What does God mean by this parable?&quot; He causes some to err this way, and some He guides; yet He turns away none but those who transgress,"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Who, having sealed it, break God's covenant, dividing what He ordained cohered; and those who spread discord in the land will suffer assuredly."/>
		<aya index="28" text="Then how can you disbelieve in God? He gave you life when you were dead. He will make you die again then bring you back to life: To Him then you will return."/>
		<aya index="29" text="He made for you all that lies within the earth, then turning to the firmament He proportioned several skies: He has knowledge of everything."/>
		<aya index="30" text="Remember, when your Lord said to the angels: &quot;I have to place a trustee on the earth,&quot; they said: &quot;Will You place one there who would create disorder and shed blood, while we intone Your litanies and sanctify Your name?&quot; And God said: &quot;I know what you do not know.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="31" text="Then He gave Adam knowledge of the nature and reality of all things and everything, and set them before the angels and said: &quot;Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="And they said: &quot;Glory to You (O Lord), knowledge we have none except what You have given us, for You are all-knowing and all-wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="33" text="Then He said to Adam: &quot;Convey to them their names.&quot; And when he had told them, God said: &quot;Did I not tell you that I know the unknown of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you disclose and know what you hide?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="34" text="Remember, when We asked the angels to bow in homage to Adam, they all bowed but Iblis, who disdained and turned insolent, and so became a disbeliever."/>
		<aya index="35" text="And We said to Adam: &quot;Both you and your spouse live in the Garden, eat freely to your fill wherever you like, but approach not this tree or you will become transgressors."/>
		<aya index="36" text="But Satan tempted them and had them banished from the (happy) state they were in. And We said: &quot;Go, one the antagonist of the other, and live on the earth for a time ordained, and fend for yourselves.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="37" text="Then his Lord sent commands to Adam and turned towards him: Indeed He is compassionate and kind."/>
		<aya index="38" text="And We said to them: &quot;Go, all of you. When I send guidance, whoever follows it will neither have fear nor regret;"/>
		<aya index="39" text="But those who deny and reject Our signs will belong to Hell, and there abide unchanged.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="40" text="O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you. So keep your pledge to Me, and I will mine to you, and be fearful of Me,"/>
		<aya index="41" text="And believe in what I have sent down which verifies what is already with you; and do not be the first to deny it, nor part with it for little gain; and beware of Me."/>
		<aya index="42" text="Do not confuse truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly."/>
		<aya index="43" text="Be firm in devotion; give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others), and bow with those who bow (before God)."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Will you enjoin good deeds on the others and forget your own selves? You also read the Scriptures, why do you then not understand?"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Find strength in fortitude and prayer, which is heavy and exacting but for those who are humble and meek,"/>
		<aya index="46" text="Who are conscious that they have to meet their Lord, and to Him they have to return."/>
		<aya index="47" text="Remember, O children of Israel, the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world."/>
		<aya index="48" text="Take heed of the day when no man will be useful to man in the least, when no intercession matter nor ransom avail, nor help reach them."/>
		<aya index="49" text="Remember, We saved you from the Pharaoh's people who wronged and oppressed you and slew your sons but spared your women: In this was a great favour from your Lord."/>
		<aya index="50" text="Remember, We parted the sea and saved you, and drowned the men of Pharaoh before your very eyes."/>
		<aya index="51" text="Yet, remember, as We communed with Moses for forty nights you took the calf in his absence (and worshipped it), and you did wrong."/>
		<aya index="52" text="Even so, We pardoned you that you may be grateful."/>
		<aya index="53" text="Remember, We gave Moses the Book and Discernment of falsehood and truth, that you may be guided."/>
		<aya index="54" text="Remember, Moses said: &quot;My people, by taking this calf you have done yourselves harm, so now turn to your Creator in repentance, and kill your pride, which is better with your Lord.&quot; And (the Lord) softened towards you, for He is all-forgiving and merciful."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Remember, when you said to Moses: &quot;We shall not believe in you until we see God face to face,&quot; lightning struck you as you looked."/>
		<aya index="56" text="Even then We revived you after you had become senseless that you might give thanks;"/>
		<aya index="57" text="And made the cloud spread shade over you, and sent for you manna and quails that you may eat of the good things We have made for you. No harm was done to Us, they only harmed themselves."/>
		<aya index="58" text="And remember, We said to you: &quot;Enter this city, eat wherever you like, as much as you please, but pass through the gates in humility and say: 'May our sins be forgiven.' We shall forgive your trespasses and give those who do good abundance."/>
		<aya index="59" text="But the wicked changed and perverted the word We had spoken to a word distorted, and We sent from heaven retribution on the wicked, for they disobeyed."/>
		<aya index="60" text="And remember, when Moses asked for water for his people, We told him to strike the rock with his staff, and behold, twelve springs of gushing water gushed forth so that each of the tribes came to know its place of drinking. Eat and drink, (enjoy) God's gifts, and spread no discord in the land."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Remember, when you said: &quot;O Moses, we are tired of eating the same food (day after day), ask your Lord to give us fruits of the earth, herbs and cucumbers, grains and lentils and onions;&quot; he said: &quot;Would you rather exchange what is good with what is bad? Go then to the city, you shall have what you ask.&quot; So they were disgraced and became indigent, earning the anger of God, for they disbelieved the word of God, and slayed the prophets unjustly, for they transgressed and rebelled."/>
		<aya index="62" text="Surely the believers and the Jews, Nazareans and the Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day, and whosoever does right, shall have his reward with his Lord and will neither have fear nor regret."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Remember the day We made the covenant with you and exalted you on the Mount and said: &quot;Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is therein that you may take heed.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="But you went back (on your word), and but for the mercy and grace of God you were lost."/>
		<aya index="65" text="You know and have known already those among you who had broken the sanctity of the Sabbath, and to whom We had said: &quot;Become (like) apes despised,&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="And whom We made an example for the people (of the day) and those after them, and warning for those who fear God."/>
		<aya index="67" text="Remember, when Moses said to his people: &quot;God demands that you sacrifice a cow,&quot; they said: &quot;Are you making fun of us?&quot; And he said: &quot;God forbid that I be of the ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="68" text="&quot;Call on your Lord for us,&quot; they said, &quot;that He might inform us what kind she should be.&quot; &quot;Neither old nor young, says God, but of age in between,&quot; answered Moses. &quot;So do as you are bid.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="&quot;Call on your Lord,&quot; they said, &quot;to tell us the colour of the cow.&quot; &quot;God says,&quot; answered Moses, &quot;a fawn coloured cow, rich yellow, well pleasing to the eye.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="&quot;Call on your Lord,&quot; they said, &quot;to name its variety, as cows be all alike to us. If God wills we shall be guided aright.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="And Moses said: &quot;He says it's a cow unyoked, nor worn out by ploughing or watering the fields, one in good shape with no mark or blemish.&quot; &quot;Now have you brought us the truth,&quot; they said; and then, after wavering, they sacrificed the cow."/>
		<aya index="72" text="Remember when you killed a man and blamed each other for the deed, God brought to light what you concealed."/>
		<aya index="73" text="We had pronounced already: &quot;Slay (the murderer) for (taking a life).&quot; Thus God preserves life from death and shows you His signs that you may understand."/>
		<aya index="74" text="Yet, in spite of this, your hearts only hardened like rocks or even harder, but among rocks are those from which rivers flow; and there are also those which split open and water gushes forth; as well as those that roll down for fear of God. And God is not negligent of all that you do."/>
		<aya index="75" text="How do you expect them to put their faith in you, when you know that some among them heard the word of God and, having understood, perverted it knowingly?"/>
		<aya index="76" text="For when they meet the faithful, they say: &quot;We believe;&quot; but when among themselves, they say: &quot;Why do you tell them what the Lord has revealed to you? They will only dispute it in the presence of your Lord. Have you no sense indeed?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="Do they not know that God is aware of what they hide and what they disclose?"/>
		<aya index="78" text="Among them are heathens who know nothing of the Book but only what they wish to believe, and are only lost in fantasies."/>
		<aya index="79" text="But woe to them who fake the Scriptures and say: &quot;This is from God,&quot; so that they might earn some profit thereby; and woe to them for what they fake, and woe to them for what they earn from it!"/>
		<aya index="80" text="Yet they say: &quot;The Fire will not touch us for more than a few days.&quot; Say.. &quot;Have you so received a promise from God?&quot; &quot;Then surely God will not withdraw His pledge. Or do you impute things to God of which you have no knowledge at all?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="81" text="Why, they who have earned the wages of sin and are enclosed in error, are people of Hell, where they will abide for ever."/>
		<aya index="82" text="But those who believe and do good deeds are people of Paradise, and shall live there forever."/>
		<aya index="83" text="Remember, when We made a covenant with the people of Israel and said: &quot;Worship no one but God, and be good to your parents and your kin, and to orphans and the needy, and speak of goodness to men; observe your devotional obligations, and give zakat (the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others),&quot; you went back (on your word), except only a few, and paid no heed."/>
		<aya index="84" text="And remember, when We made a covenant with you whereby you agreed you will neither shed blood among you nor turn your people out of their homes, you promised, and are witness to it too."/>
		<aya index="85" text="But you still kill one another, and you turn a section of your people from their homes, assisting one another against them with guilt and oppression. Yet when they are brought to you as captives you ransom them, although forbidden it was to drive them away. Do you, then, believe a part of the Book and reject a part? There is no other award for them who so act but disgrace in the world, and on the Day of Judgement the severest of punishment; for God is not heedless of all that you do."/>
		<aya index="86" text="They are those who bought the life of the world at the cost of the life to come; and neither will their torment decrease nor help reach them."/>
		<aya index="87" text="Remember We gave Moses the Book and sent after him many an apostle; and to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear evidence of the truth, reinforcing him with divine grace. Even so, when a messenger brought to you what did not suit your mood you turned haughty, and called some imposters and some others you slew."/>
		<aya index="88" text="And they say: &quot;Our hearts are enfolded in covers.&quot; In fact God has cursed them for their unbelief; and only a little do they believe."/>
		<aya index="89" text="And when the Book was sent to them by God verifying what had been revealed to them already even though before it they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers and even though they recognised it when it came to them, they renounced it. The curse of God be on those who deny!"/>
		<aya index="90" text="They bartered their lives ill denying the revelation of God out of spite that God should bestow His grace among His votaries on whomsoever He will, and thus earned wrath upon wrath. The punishment for disbelievers is ignominious."/>
		<aya index="91" text="And when it is said to them: &quot;believe in what God has sent down,&quot; they say: &quot;We believe what was sent to us, and do not believe what has come thereafter,&quot; although it affirms the truth they possess already. Say: &quot;Why have you then been slaying God's apostles as of old, if you do believe?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="92" text="Although Moses had come to you with evidence of the truth, you chose the calf in his absence, and you transgressed."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Remember when We took your pledge and exalted you on the Mount (saying:) &quot;Hold fast to what We have given you, firmly, and pay heed,&quot; you said: &quot;We have heard and will not obey.&quot; (The image of) the calf had sunk deep into their hearts on account of unbelief. Say: &quot;Vile is your belief if you are believers indeed!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="Tell them: &quot;If you think you alone will abide with God to the exclusion of the rest of Mankind, in the mansions of the world to come, then wish for death if what you say is true.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="But they will surely not wish for death because of what they had done in the past; and God knows the sinners well."/>
		<aya index="96" text="You will see they are covetous of life more than other men, even more than those who practise idolatry. Each one of them desires to live a thousand years, although longevity will never save them from punishment, for God sees all they do."/>
		<aya index="97" text="Say: &quot;Whosoever is the enemy of Gabriel who revealed the word of God to you by the dispensation of God, reaffirming what had been revealed before, and is a guidance and good news for those who believe, --"/>
		<aya index="98" text="Whosoever is the enemy of God and His angels and apostles, and of Gabriel and Michael, then God is the enemy of such unbelievers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="We have sent clear signs to you, such as none can deny except those who transgress the truth."/>
		<aya index="100" text="And every time they made a pledge some of them pushed it aside, and many of them do not believe."/>
		<aya index="101" text="When a messenger was sent to them by God affirming the Books they had already received, some of them put (His message) behind their backs as if they had no knowledge of it."/>
		<aya index="102" text="And they follow what devilish beings used to chant against the authority of Solomon, though Solomon never disbelieved and only the devils denied, who taught sorcery to men, which, they said, had been revealed to the angels of Babylon, Harut and Marut, who, however, never taught it without saying: &quot;We have been sent to deceive you, so do not renounce (your faith).&quot; They learnt what led to discord between husband and wife. Yet they could not harm any one or without the dispensation of God. And they learnt what harmed them and brought no gain. They knew indeed whoever bought this had no place in the world to come, and that surely they had sold themselves for something that was vile. If only they had sense!"/>
		<aya index="103" text="Had they come to believe instead, and taken heed for themselves, they would surely have earned from God a far better reward. If only they had sense!"/>
		<aya index="104" text="Say not (to the Prophet), O Believers: &quot;Have regard for us (ra'ina),&quot; but &quot;look at us (unzurna),&quot; and obey him in what he says. Painful is the nemesis for disbelievers."/>
		<aya index="105" text="Those without faith among the people of the Book, and those who worship idols, do not wish that good should come to you from your Lord. But God chooses whom He likes for His grace; and the bounty of God is infinite."/>
		<aya index="106" text="When We cancel a message (sent to an earlier prophet) or throw it into oblivion, We replace it with one better or one similar. Do you not know that God has power over all things?"/>
		<aya index="107" text="Do you not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that there is none to save and protect you apart from God?"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Do you too, O believers, wish to question your Apostle as Moses was in the past? But he who takes unbelief in exchange for belief only strays from the right path."/>
		<aya index="109" text="How many of the followers of the Books having once known the truth desire in their hearts, out of envy, to turn you into infidels again even after the truth has become clear to them! But you forbear and overlook till God fulfil His plan; and God has power over all things."/>
		<aya index="110" text="Fulfil your devotional obligations and pay the zakat. And what you send ahead of good you will find with God, for He sees all that you do ill."/>
		<aya index="111" text="And they say: &quot;None will go to Paradise but the Jews and the Christians;&quot; but this is only wishful thinking. Say: &quot;Bring the proof if you are truthful.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="112" text="Only he who surrenders to God with all his heart and also does good, will find his reward with his Lord, and will have no fear or regret."/>
		<aya index="113" text="The Jews say: &quot;The Christians are not right,&quot; and the Christians say: &quot;The Jews are in the wrong;&quot; yet both read the Scriptures; and this is what the unread had said too. God alone will judge between them in their differences on the Day of Reckoning."/>
		<aya index="114" text="And who is more unjust than he who prohibits the name of God being used in His mosques, who hurries to despoil them even though he has no right to enter them except in reverence? For them is ignominy in the world and severe punishment in the life to come."/>
		<aya index="115" text="To God belong the East and the West. Wherever you turn the glory of God is everywhere: All-pervading is He and all-knowing."/>
		<aya index="116" text="Yet they say that God has begotten a son. May He be praised! Indeed everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, and all are obedient to God."/>
		<aya index="117" text="Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothingness, He has only to say when He wills a thing: &quot;Be&quot;, and it is."/>
		<aya index="118" text="But those who are ignorant say: &quot;Why does God not speak or show us a sign?&quot; The same question had been asked by men before them, who were like them in their hearts. But to those who are firm in their faith We have shown Our signs already."/>
		<aya index="119" text="And We have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn. You will not be questioned about those and who are inmates of Hell."/>
		<aya index="120" text="The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their way. Say: &quot;God's guidance alone is true guidance;&quot; for if you give in to their wishes after having received the (Book of) knowledge from God, then none will you have as friend or helper to save you."/>
		<aya index="121" text="Those to whom We have sent down the Book, and who read it as it should be read, believe in it truly; but those who deny it will be losers."/>
		<aya index="122" text="O children of Israel, remember the favours I bestowed on you, and made you exalted among the nations of the world."/>
		<aya index="123" text="Fear the day when no man will stand up for man in the least, and no ransom avail nor intercession matter nor help reach."/>
		<aya index="124" text="Remember, when his Lord tried Abraham by a number of commands which he fulfilled, God said to him: &quot;I will make you a leader among men.&quot; And when Abraham asked: &quot;From my progeny too?&quot; the Lord said: &quot;My pledge does not include transgressors.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="125" text="Remember, We made the House (of Ka'bah) a place of congregation and safe retreat, and said: &quot;Make the spot where Abraham stood the place of worship;&quot; and enjoined upon Abraham and Ishmael to keep Our House immaculate for those who shall walk around it and stay in it for contemplation and prayer, and for bowing in adoration."/>
		<aya index="126" text="And when Abraham said: &quot;O Lord, make this a city of peace, and give those of its citizens who believe in God and the Last Day fruits for food,&quot; He answered: &quot;To those will I also give a little who believe not, for a time, then drag them to Hell, a dreadful destination!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="127" text="And when Abraham was raising the plinth of the House with Ishmael, (he prayed): &quot;Accept this from us, O Lord, for You hear and know everything;"/>
		<aya index="128" text="And make us submit, O Lord, to Your will, and our progeny a people submissive to You. Teach us the way of worship and forgive our trespasses, for You are compassionate and merciful;"/>
		<aya index="129" text="And send to them, O Lord, an apostle from among them to impart Your messages to them, and teach them the Book and the wisdom, and correct them in every way; for indeed You are mighty and wise."/>
		<aya index="130" text="Who will turn away from the creed of Abraham but one dull of soul? We made him the chosen one here in the world, and one of the best in the world to come,"/>
		<aya index="131" text="(For) when his Lord said to him: &quot;Obey,&quot; he replied: &quot;I submit to the Lord of all the worlds.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="132" text="And Abraham left this legacy to his sons, and to Jacob, and said: &quot;O my sons, God has chosen this as the faith for you. Do not die but as those who have submitted (to God).&quot;"/>
		<aya index="133" text="Were you present at the hour of Jacob's death? &quot;What will you worship after me?&quot; he asked his sons, and they answered: &quot;We shall worship your God and the God of your fathers, of Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, the one and only God; and to Him we submit.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="255" text="God: There is no god but He, the living, eternal, self-subsisting, ever sustaining. Neither does somnolence affect Him nor sleep. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth: and who can intercede with Him except by His leave? Known to Him is all that is present before men and what is hidden (in time past and time future), and not even a little of His knowledge can they grasp except what He will. His seat extends over heavens and the earth, and He tires not protecting them: He alone is all high and supreme."/>
		<aya index="256" text="There is no compulsion in matter of faith. Distinct is the way of guidance now from error. He who turns away from the forces of evil and believes in God, will surely hold fast to a handle that is strong and unbreakable, for God hears all and knows everything."/>
		<aya index="257" text="God is the friend of those who believe, and leads them out of darkness into light; but the patrons of infidels are idols and devils who lead them from light into darkness. They are the residents of Hell, and will there for ever abide."/>
		<aya index="258" text="Have you thought of the man who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him a kingdom? When Abraham said: &quot;My Lord is the giver of life and death,&quot; he replied: &quot;I am the giver of life and death.&quot; And Abraham said: &quot;God makes the sun rise from the East; so you make it rise from the West,&quot; and dumbfounded was the infidel. God does not guide those who are unjust."/>

He said: &quot;How can God restore this city now that it is destroyed?&quot; So God made him die for a hundred years, then brought him back to life, and inquired: &quot;How long did you stay in this state?&quot; &quot;A day or less than a day,&quot; he replied. &quot;No,&quot; He said, &quot;you were dead a hundred years, yet look at your victuals, they have not decomposed; and look at your ass! We shall make you a warning for men. And regard the bones, how We raise them and clothe them with flesh.&quot; When this became clear to him, the man said: &quot;Indeed God has power over all things.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="260" text="Remember, when Abraham said: &quot;O Lord, show me how you raise the dead,&quot; He said: &quot;What! Do you not believe?&quot; &quot;I do,&quot; answered Abraham. &quot;I only ask for my heart's assurance.&quot; (The Lord) said: &quot;Trap four birds and tame them, then put each of them on a (separate) hill, and call them, and they will come flying to you. Know that God is all-powerful and all-wise.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="261" text="The semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears, each ear containing a hundred grains. Truly God increases for whomsoever He will, for God is infinite and all-wise."/>

		<aya index="264" text="O believers, do not nullify your charity by giving to oblige and flaunting (your favours) like a man who spends of his wealth only to show off, but does not believe in God and the Last Day. His semblance is that of a rock covered with earth which is washed away by rain exposing the hard rock bare. So they gain nothing from their earnings. God does not guide a people who do not believe."/>
		<aya index="265" text="But the semblance of those who expend their wealth to please God with firm and resolute hearts, is like a garden on a height on which the rain falls and it yields its fruits twice as much; and even if the rain does not fall the dew will suffice. For God sees all that you do."/>
		<aya index="266" text="Does any of you wish to have an orchard full of date-palm trees and vines, and streams of running water and fruits of all kinds, and then old age should overtake him while his children are small, and a scorching whirlwind should smite and burn it down? Thus God makes His signs clear to you that you may reflect."/>
		<aya index="267" text="O believers, give in charity what is good of the things you have earned, and of what you produce from the earth; and do not choose to give what is bad as alms, that is, things you would not like to accept yourself except with some condescension. Remember that God is affluent and praiseworthy."/>

		<aya index="271" text="If you give alms openly, it is well; but if you do it secretly and give to the poor, that is better. This will absolve you of some of your sins; and God is cognisant of all you do."/>
		<aya index="272" text="It is not for you to guide them: God guides whom He will. Whatever you spend you will do so for yourself, for you will do so to seek the way that leads to God; and what you spend in charity you will get back in full, and no wrong will be done to you."/>
		<aya index="273" text="(Give to) the needy who are engaged in the service of God who are not able to move about in the land, whom the ignorant consider to be affluent as they refrain from asking. You can know them from their faces for they do not ask of men importunately. God is surely cognisant of good things that you spend."/>

		<aya index="275" text="Those who live on usury will not rise (on Doomsday) but like a man possessed of the devil and demented. This because they say that trading is like usury. But trade has been sanctioned and usury forbidden by God. Those who are warned by their Lord and desist will keep (what they have taken of interest) already, and the matter will rest with God. But those who revert to it again are the residents of Hell where they will abide for ever."/>
		<aya index="276" text="God takes away (gain) from usury, but adds (profit) to charity; and God does not love the ungrateful and sinners."/>

		<aya index="281" text="Have fear of the day when you go back to God. Then each will be paid back in full his reward, and no one will be wronged."/>
		<aya index="282" text="O believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing, though better it would be to have a scribe write it faithfully down; and no scribe should refuse to write as God has taught him, and write what the borrower dictates, and have fear of God, his Lord, and not leave out a thing. If the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm, or unable to explain, let the guardian explain judiciously; and have two of your men to act as witnesses; but if two men are not available, then a man and two women you approve, so that in case one of them is confused the other may prompt her. When the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse (to come). But do not neglect to draw up a contract, big or small, with the time fixed for paying back the debt. This is more equitable in the eyes of God, and better as evidence and best for avoiding doubt. But if it is a deal about some merchandise requiring transaction face to face, there is no harm if no (contract is drawn up) in writing. Have witnesses to the deal, (and make sure) that the scribe or the witness is not harmed. If he is, it would surely be sinful on your part. And have fear of God, for God gives you knowledge, and God is aware of everything."/>
		<aya index="283" text="If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, pledge your goods (against the Loan); and if one trusts the other, then let him who is trusted deliver the thing entrusted, and have fear of God, his Lord. Do not suppress any evidence, for he who conceals evidence is sinful of heart; and God is aware of all you do."/>
		<aya index="284" text="To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; and whether you reveal what is in your heart or conceal it, you will have to account for it to God who will pardon whom He please and punish whom He will, for God has the power over all things."/>
		<aya index="285" text="The Prophet believes in what has been revealed to him by his Lord, and so do the faithful. Each one believes in God and His angels, His Books and the prophets, and We make no distinction between the apostles. For they say: &quot;We hear and obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O Lord, for to You we shall journey in the end.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="286" text="God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. Each will enjoy what (good) he earns, as indeed each will suffer from (the wrong) he does. Punish us not, O Lord, if we fail to remember or lapse into error. Burden us not, O Lord, with a burden as You did those before us. Impose not upon us a burden, O Lord, we cannot carry. Overlook our trespasses and forgive us, and have mercy upon us; You are our Lord and Master, help us against the clan of unbelievers."/>

		<aya index="174" text="O men, you have received infallible proof from your Lord, and We have sent down a beacon light to you."/>
		<aya index="175" text="So those who believe in God and hold fast to Him shall indeed be received into His mercy and His grace, and be guided to Him the straight path."/>
		<aya index="176" text="They ask you for judgement about 'Kalalah' (a man who dies childless). Say: &quot;God has given a decision in the matter of inheritance.&quot; If a man dies and leaves no child behind but have a sister, she will get a half of what he owned, as he would have done the whole of what she possessed if she had died a childless person. In ease he has two sisters then they will get two-thirds of the heritage. But if he has both brothers and sisters, the male will inherit a share equal to that of two females. God makes this manifest to you lest you wander astray, for God has knowledge of everything."/>

Hunt when you have laid aside the robe of the pilgrim. And do not let your hatred of a people who had barred you from the Holy Mosque lead you to aggression. But help one another in goodness and piety, and do not assist in crime and rebellion, and fear God. Surely God is severe in punishment."/>

All this is sinful. Today the unbelievers have lost every hope of (despoiling) your creed; so do not fear them, fear Me. Today I have perfected your system of belief and bestowed My favours upon you in full, and have chosen submission (al-Islam) as the creed for you. If one of you is driven by hunger (to eat the forbidden) without the evil intent of sinning, then God is forgiving and kind."/>

But in case you are ill or are travelling, or you have satisfied the call of nature, or have slept with a woman, and you cannot find water, then take wholesome dust and pass it over your face and your hands, for God does not wish to impose any hardship on you.

So, therefore, do not fear men, fear Me, and barter not My messages away for a paltry gain. Those who do not judge by God's revelations are infidels indeed."/>
		<aya index="45" text="And there (in the Torah) We had ordained for them a life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds retribution, though he who forgoes it out of charity, atones for his sins. And those who do not judge by God's revelations are unjust."/>
		<aya index="46" text="Later, in the train (of the prophets), We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah which had been (Sent down) before him, and gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, which corroborated the earlier Torah, a guidance and warning for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path."/>

So judge between them by what has been revealed by God, and do not follow their whims, side-stepping the truth that has reached you. To each of you We have given a law and a way and a pattern of life. If God had pleased He could surely have made you one people (professing one faith). But He wished to try and test you by that which He gave you. So try to excel in good deeds. To Him will you all return in the end, when He will tell you of what you were at variance."/>

Then will they be repentant of what they had concealed in their hearts."/>

		<aya index="54" text="O believers, any one of you who turns back on his faith (should remember) that God could verily bring (in your place) another people whom He would love as they would love Him, gentle with believers, unbending with infidels, who would strive in the way of God, unafraid of blame by any slanderer. Such is the favour of God which He bestows on whomsoever He will. God is infinite and all-knowing."/>

In fact, both His hands are open wide: He spends of His bounty in any way He please. But what your Lord has revealed to you will only increase their rebellion and unbelief. So We have caused enmity and hatred among them (which will last) till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by God. Yet they rush around to spread corruption in the land; but God does not love those who are corrupt."/>

O Prophet, announce what has reached you from your Lord, for if you do not, you will not have delivered His message.

		<aya index="68" text="Say to them: &quot;O people of the Book, you have no ground (for argument) until you follow the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to you by your Lord.&quot; But what has been revealed to you by your Lord will surely increase rebellion and unbelief in many; so do not grieve for those who do not believe."/>

It is, therefore, better for you to repent. If you do not, remember that you cannot elude (the grip of) God. So announce to those who deny the truth the news of painful punishment,"/>
		<aya index="4" text="Except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty, who have not failed you in the least, nor helped anyone against you. Fulfil your obligations to them during the term (of the treaty). God loves those who take heed for themselves."/>

		<aya index="30" text="The Jews say: &quot;Ezra is the son of God;&quot; the Christians say: &quot;Christ is the son of God.&quot; That is what they say with their tongues following assertions made by unbelievers before them. May they be damned by God: How perverse are they!"/>

		<aya index="34" text="O believers, many rabbis and priests devour the possessions of others wrongfully, and keep men away from the path of God. To those who accumulate gold and silver, and do not spend in the way of God, announce the news of painful punishment."/>

This is the straight reckoning. So do not exceed yourselves during them; but fight the idolaters to the end as they fight you in like manner; and remember, God is with those Who preserve themselves from evil and do the right."/>
		<aya index="37" text="Intercalating a month is adding to unbelief. The unbelievers are misguided by this, for they take the same month to be sacred one year and sacrilegious the next, thus making the number of months sanctified by God accord with theirs in order to make what God has forbidden, lawful. Attractive seem to them their evil deeds; but God does not show the unbelievers the way."/>
		<aya index="38" text="What has happened to you, O believers, that when you are asked to set out in the cause of God your feet begin to drag? Do you find the life of the world so pleasing that you forget the life to come? Yet the profit of the life of this world is but meagre as compared to the life to come."/>
		<aya index="39" text="Unless you go out (to strive), God will inflict grievous punishment on you, and bring other people in your place, and you will not be able to harm Him in the least, for God has the power over all things."/>
		<aya index="40" text="If you do not help (the Prophet, remember) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave (and he was) one of two. When both of them were in the cave, he said to his companion: &quot;Do not grieve, for God is with us.&quot; Then God sent divine peace on him, and invisible armies for his help, and made the unbelievers' purpose abject. Most exalted is God's word, for God is all-mighty and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="41" text="O believers, go out in the cause of God, (whether) light or heavy, and strive in the service of God, wealth and soul. This is better for you if you understand."/>

Even then they swear by God (and say): &quot;If we had the strength we would surely have gone out with you.&quot; They are only ruining themselves, for God is aware they lie."/>
		<aya index="43" text="May God forgive you. Why did you allow them (to stay behind) without ascertaining who spoke the truth and who were liars?"/>
		<aya index="44" text="Those who believe in God and the Last Day, do not ask your leave to be excused from fighting wealth and soul (in the cause of God), for God knows the pious and devout."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Only they ask (for leave) who do not believe in God and the Last Day, whose hearts are full of doubt; and doubting they waver (between gain and loss)."/>
		<aya index="46" text="If they had intended to go out (to fight) they would surely have made preparations. But God did not like their setting forth, and they were held back and told: &quot;Stay at home with those who stay behind.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="51" text="Tell them: &quot;Nothing can befall us except what God decrees. Our protector is He, and in God should the faithful place their trust.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="52" text="Say: &quot;Are you waiting for anything else but one of two good things for us, (victory or martyrdom)? Yet what we are waiting for you is the punishment of God, direct or through us. So keep waiting; we are waiting with you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="Tell them: &quot;You may spend (in the way of God), whether willingly or with reluctance, it will not be accepted from you, for you are reprobates.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="54" text="Nothing prevents the acceptance of what they spend except that they do not believe in God and His Apostle, and come to worship but languidly and spend only grudgingly."/>
		<aya index="55" text="Do not marvel at their wealth and children. God intends to punish them through these in the world; and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief."/>
		<aya index="56" text="They swear by God they are with you, though in fact they are not. They are only a frightened lot."/>
		<aya index="57" text="If they find a place of shelter or a cave or hole to hide, they will turn to it."/>
		<aya index="58" text="There are some among them who blame you (of partiality) in distributing the offerings made in the name of God. In case they receive some of these they are pleased, if not, they are incensed."/>
		<aya index="59" text="They should rather have been pleased with what God and His Prophet had given them, and said: &quot;God is sufficient for us; He will give us of His largesse as will His Apostle. We supplicate no one but God.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="60" text="Charities are meant for the indigent and needy, and those who collect and distribute them, and those whom you wish to win over, and for redeeming slaves (and captives) and those who are burdened with debt, and in the cause of God, and the wayfarers: So does God ordain. God is all-knowing and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="61" text="There are some among them who talk ill of the Prophet by saying: &quot;He listens to everyone.&quot; Tell them: &quot;He listens for your good, and trusts in God and trusts the faithful, and he is a blessing for those who believe. For those who offend the Apostle of God there is painful punishment.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="They swear by God to please you; but if they are believers it would have been worthier to have pleased God and His Apostle."/>
		<aya index="63" text="Have they not realised that anyone who opposes God and His Prophet, will abide in Hell for ever? And that is the worst disgrace."/>
		<aya index="64" text="The hypocrites fear lest a Surah is revealed concerning them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say to them: &quot;Mock as much as you like; God will surely expose what you dread.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="But if you ask them, they will say: &quot;We were only gossiping and jesting.&quot; You ask them: &quot;Were you jesting with God, His revelations and His messengers?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="66" text="Do not make excuses: You turned unbelievers after having come to faith. If We pardon a section of you (for being frivolous), We shall punish the other for being guilty (of deliberate sin)."/>
		<aya index="67" text="The hypocrites (are the same) whether men or women, the one of them being of the other. They encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good, and tighten their purses (when it comes to spending in the way of God). Of God they are oblivious; so He is oblivious of them. The hypocrites are indeed transgressors."/>
		<aya index="68" text="God has reserved for hypocrites, whether men or women, and for unbelievers, the fire of Hell, where they will abide for ever. This is sufficient for them: They have God's condemnation and lasting torment,"/>
		<aya index="69" text="Like those before you who were greater in strength, had more wealth and children than you, who enjoyed their lot in this world, as you have enjoyed your share like them. You indulge in idle talk, as they had indulged in vain discourse. Yet nothing of what they did remains in this world or will in the next, and they are the losers."/>
		<aya index="70" text="Has not the account of those before them come to them, -- of the people of Noah and 'Ad and Thamud, of Abraham and Midian, and all the habitations that were destroyed? Their apostles had come to them with clear proofs; and God did not surely wrong them, they wronged themselves."/>
		<aya index="71" text="Those who believe, men and women, befriend one another, and enjoin what is right and prohibit what is wrong. They observe their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey God and His Apostle. God will be merciful to them, for God is all-mighty and all-wise."/>
		<aya index="72" text="God has promised men and women who believe gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever, and beautiful mansions in the Garden of Eden, and the blessings of God above all. That will be happiness supreme."/>
		<aya index="73" text="Strive, O Prophet, against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and deal with them firmly. Their final abode is Hell: And what a wretched destination!"/>
		<aya index="74" text="They swear by God: &quot;We never said this.&quot; But they surely said words disbelieving the truth, and they turned unbelievers after having come to faith, and designed what they could not accomplish. They did it only out of vengeance for God and His Apostle had enriched them by their grace. So, if they repent it is better for them. If they turn away then God would afflict them with painful punishment in this world and the next; and none will they have on the face of the earth to protect or help them."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Some of them made a covenant with God: &quot;If You give us in Your bounty we shall give alms and be upright.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="76" text="But when He gave them of His bounty they became greedy, and then turned away."/>
		<aya index="77" text="As a consequence of breaking their promise made to God, and telling lies, he filled their hearts with hypocrisy which will last till the day they come before Him."/>
		<aya index="78" text="Have they not realised that God knows their secrets and their confidential talk, and that God has the knowledge of unknown things?"/>
		<aya index="79" text="They who defame those of the believers who give alms willingly, and deride those who have nothing besides what they earn by their labour (to give in charity), will be derided by God, and will suffer painful punishment."/>
		<aya index="80" text="Whether you plead forgiveness for them or not, God will not forgive them, even though you plead seventy times, for they disbelieved in God and His Apostle; and God does not show transgressors the way."/>
		<aya index="81" text="Those who were left behind rejoiced that they stayed at home against the wishes of God's Apostle, being averse to fighting in the way of God with their wealth and lives, and said: &quot;Do not go in this heat.&quot; Tell them: &quot;The heat of Hell is far more intense.&quot; If only they had cared to instruct themselves!"/>
		<aya index="82" text="So let them laugh a little, for weep they will, more as retribution for what they have done."/>

		<aya index="85" text="And let not their wealth and children astonish you. God wishes to punish them through these in the world, and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief."/>
		<aya index="86" text="Whenever a Surah is revealed (which says): &quot;Believe in God and fight along with His Prophet,&quot; the well-to-do among them ask for leave to stay at home, and say: &quot;Leave us with those who are left behind.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="90" text="Some Arabs of the desert came with ready excuses, asking for leave to stay behind. But those who had lied to God and His Prophet stayed at home doing nothing. So the punishment for those who disbelieve among them will be painful."/>
		<aya index="91" text="No blame will attach to the old and the sick, or those without means to spend on good acts, if they stay behind provided they are sincere to God and His Apostle; There is no way to blame those who are doers of good, for God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="92" text="Nor will they be blamed who came to you for transport, to whom you said: &quot;I cannot find any means of conveyance for you,&quot; and they went away in tears, grieving that they lacked the means to spend (on carriage)."/>

		<aya index="94" text="When you come back they will offer excuses to you. Tell them: &quot;Make no excuses; we do not believe you. God has informed us about you; and God and His Apostle shall watch your conduct. Then you will be brought to Him who knows what is hidden and what is manifest. He will tell you of what you did.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="They will beg you in the name of God, on your return, to forgive them; but you keep away from them: They are scum; their abode is Hell: Requital for what they had done."/>

		<aya index="97" text="The village Arabs are more obstinate in disbelief and hypocrisy, and impervious to ordinances revealed to His Apostle by God; yet God is aware of everything and is wise."/>
		<aya index="98" text="Some of these rustics take whatever they spend in the way of God as a penalty, and wait for an adverse turn in your fortune. For them will be the adverse change, as God hears all and knows everything."/>
		<aya index="99" text="Yet some Arabs of the desert believe in God and the Last Day, and consider what they spend to be a means of bringing them nearer to God and the blessings of the Prophet. This is certainly a means of achieving nearness (to God), and God will admit them to His mercy, for God is forgiving and kind."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Those among the migrants (from Makkah) and helpers (in Madina) who were the first to believe, and those who followed them in goodness, have been accepted by God and they follow His way. For them He has gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever; and that is happiness supreme."/>

Yet they will surely swear: &quot;We had only meant well.&quot; But God is witness that they are liars."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Never set foot in that place. Only a mosque whose foundations have been laid from the very first on godliness is worthy of your visiting it. There you will find men who wish to be purified; and God loves those who are pure."/>

But God does not guide the people who are wilfully unjust."/>

This is a promise incumbent on Him, as in the Torah, so the Gospel and the Qur'an. And who is more true to his promise than God? So rejoice at the bargain you have made with Him; for this will be triumph supreme."/>

		<aya index="114" text="As for Abraham's prayer for his father, he was fulfilling a promise he had made to him. Yet when it became evident to him that (his father) was an enemy of God, he broke away from him, though Abraham was soft hearted and kind."/>
		<aya index="115" text="God never leads men astray after guiding them, until He makes quite clear to them what they should avoid, for God indeed knows each and everything."/>

I do not claim to be an angel, nor can I say that God will not bestow any good on those you disdain, for God is cognisant of what is in their hearts. If I say this, I will surely be unjust.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="32" text="They said: &quot;O Noah, you have argued with us, and disputed at length; so bring that (retribution) you promise, if you speak the truth.&quot;"/>

		<aya index="34" text="Even if I wish to advise you aright, my counsel will not profit you if God intend that you go astray, for He is your Lord and to Him you will return.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="35" text="Do they say you have fabricated it? Tell them: &quot;If I have fabricated it, then mine is the guilt; but I am clear of what you are guilty.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="36" text="And Noah was informed through revelation: &quot;Apart from those who have come to believe already not one of your people is going to believe. So grieve not for what they are doing."/>
		<aya index="37" text="Build an ark under Our eye and as We instruct. Do not plead for those who have been wicked, for they shall certainly be drowned.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="38" text="So he built the ark; and when groups of his people passed by him, they scoffed at him. He said to them: &quot;Though you laugh at us (now), we shall laugh at you, as you are laughing at us."/>
		<aya index="39" text="You will soon come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame, and who suffers lasting torment.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="40" text="When Our command was issued and the waters gushed forth from the source, We said: &quot;Take into (the ark) a pair of every species, and members of your family other than those against whom the sentence has been passed already, and those who come to believe.&quot; But only a few believed in him."/>
		<aya index="41" text="And (Noah) said: &quot;Embark. In the name of God be its course and mooring. My Lord is surely forgiving and kind.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="42" text="It sailed on waves like mountains (high), and Noah called to his son who was separated from him: &quot;Embark with us, O my son, and be not one of those who do not believe.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="43" text="&quot;I shall go up a mountain,&quot; he said, &quot;which will keep me from the water.&quot; &quot;There is no getting away,&quot; said Noah, &quot;from the decree of God today, except for those on whom be His mercy.&quot; And a wave came between them, and he was among those who were drowned."/>
		<aya index="44" text="Then it was said: &quot;O earth, swallow back your water; and, O sky, desist.&quot; And the water subsided, and the decree was accomplished. The ark came to rest on Judi (Mount Ararat), and it was said: &quot;Away with the cursed people!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="45" text="Noah called on his Lord and said: &quot;O Lord, my son is surely a member of my family, and verily Your promise is true, as You are the most just of all judges.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="46" text="&quot;O Noah&quot;, He answered, &quot;truly he is not of your family. He is surely the outcome of an unrighteous act. So ask Me not of what you do not know. I warn you not to be one of the ignorant.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="47" text="&quot;Preserve me, O Lord,&quot; said (Noah), &quot;from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. If You do not forgive me and have mercy on me I shall be among those who perish.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="48" text="(And the Lord) said: &quot;O Noah, disembark with peace and safety from Us and blessings on you and the people with you. As for some (of them), We shall bestow advantages for a time, then send a grievous punishment on them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="49" text="This is news of the Unknown We reveal to you, which neither you nor your people knew before. So endure with patience. The future is for those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path."/>
		<aya index="50" text="We sent to the people of 'Ad their brother Hud, who said: &quot;O my people, worship God; you have no other god but He. (As for the idols,) you are only inventing lies."/>
		<aya index="51" text="O my people, I ask no recompense of you for it: My reward is with Him who created me. Will you not, therefore, understand?"/>
		<aya index="52" text="O my people, beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him in repentance. He will send down rain in torrents for you from the shies, and give you added strength. So do not turn away from Him as sinners.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="53" text="They said: &quot;O Hud, you have come to us with no proofs. We shall not abandon our gods because you say so, nor believe in you."/>
		<aya index="54" text="All we can say is that some of our gods have smitten you with evil.&quot; He replied:&quot; I call God to witness, and you be witness too, that I am clear of what you associate (in your affairs)"/>
		<aya index="55" text="Apart from Him. Contrive against me as much as you like, and give me no respite."/>
		<aya index="56" text="I place my trust in God who is my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature that moves on the earth who is not held by the forelock firmly by Him. Verily the way of my Lord is straight."/>
		<aya index="57" text="If you turn away, then (remember) I have delivered to you the message I was sent with. My Lord will put other people in your place, and you will not be able to prevail against Him. Indeed my Lord keeps a watch over all things.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="58" text="So, when Our command was issued We rescued Hud by Our grace, and those who believed, with him, and saved them from a dreadful doom."/>
		<aya index="59" text="These were the people of 'Ad who denied the word of their Lord and rebelled against His apostles, and followed the bidding of every perverse tyrant."/>
		<aya index="60" text="So they were accursed in the world, and they will be damned on the Day of Doom. Beware! The 'Ad turned away from their Lord."/>
		<aya index="61" text="Be warned! Accursed are the people of 'Ad who were Hud's. To Thamud We Sent their brother Saleh. &quot;O my people,&quot; he said, &quot;worship God; you have no other god but He. It is He who raised you from the earth and settled you upon it. So beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is near and answers.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="62" text="They said: &quot;O Saleh, we had placed our hopes in you, but you forbid us from worshipping that which our fathers worshipped, and we are suspicious of what you are calling us to.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="He said: &quot;O my people, have you considered that if my Lord has clearly shown me the way, and I have His blessings too, who will save me then from God if I disobey? You will only add to my ruin."/>
		<aya index="64" text="O my people, this she-camel of God is a token for you. So leave her alone to graze on God's earth, and do not molest her, otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="65" text="But they hamstrung her. Then (Saleh) said: &quot;You have but three days to enjoy life in your homes. Infallible is this promise."/>
		<aya index="66" text="So, when Our command (of punishment) came We delivered Saleh by Our grace, and those who believed, with him, from the disgrace of that day. Verily your Lord is mighty and powerful."/>
		<aya index="67" text="The sinners were seized by a blast from heaven, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning,"/>
		<aya index="68" text="As though they had never lived there at all. Beware! The people of Thamud turned away from their Lord. Beware! Accursed are the people of Thamud."/>
		<aya index="69" text="Our angels came to Abraham with good news, and said: &quot;Peace on you. &quot;Peace on you too,&quot; said Abraham, and hastened to bring a roasted calf."/>
		<aya index="70" text="When they did not stretch their hands towards it he became suspicious and afraid of them. They said: &quot;Do not be afraid. We have been sent to the people of Lot.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="His wife who stood near, laughed as We gave her the good news of Isaac, and after Isaac of Jacob."/>
		<aya index="72" text="She said: &quot;Woe betide me! Will I give birth when I am old and this my husband be aged? This is indeed surprising!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="&quot;Why are you surprised at the command of God? God's mercy and blessings be upon you, O members of this household,&quot; they said. &quot;Verily He is worthy of praise and glory.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="When Abraham's fear was dispelled, and the good news had come to him, he pleaded for the people of Lot with Us."/>
		<aya index="75" text="Abraham was kind, compassionate, and penitent."/>
		<aya index="76" text="&quot;Desist from pleading, O Abraham,&quot; (they said). &quot;Your Lord's command has verily been issued, and a punishment that cannot be averted is bound to fall on them.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="So when Our angels came to Lot, he grieved for them, and felt powerless to help them, and said: &quot;This is a day of sorrow."/>
		<aya index="78" text="His people came excited to him. They were addicted to sin already. Said (Lot): &quot;O my people, these daughters of mine are cleaner (and lawful) for you. Have fear of God, and do not shame me before my guests. Is there no man of discernment among you?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="79" text="They said: &quot;You know we have no need for your daughters, and know well what we want.&quot;"/>

Their hour of doom is in the morning: Is not the morning nigh?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="82" text="So when the decreed moment arrived, We turned the habitations upside down, and rained upon them stones of hardened lava in quick succession,"/>
		<aya index="83" text="Impressed with (the signs) of your Lord. And such (punishment) is not far for the (other) transgressers."/>
		<aya index="84" text="We sent to Midian their brother Shu'aib. He said: &quot;O my people, worship God; you have no other god but He. So do not give in short measure nor underweigh. I see you are prosperous, but I fear the doom of an overwhelming Day for you."/>
		<aya index="85" text="So, O my people, weigh and measure with justness, and do not withhold things due to men, and do not spread corruption in the land, despoiling it."/>
		<aya index="86" text="That which is left to you by God is better, if you are true believers; yet I am not a warden over you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="They said: &quot;O Shu'aib, does your piety teach that we should abandon what our fathers worshipped, or desist from doing what we like with our goods? How gracious a man of discernment you are indeed!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="88" text="He said: &quot;O my people, think. I have a clear sign from my Lord, who has also given me a goodly provision, and I do not wish for myself what I forbid you: I only wish to reform you as best I can. My success is from God alone. In Him I have placed my trust, and to Him I turn."/>
		<aya index="89" text="&quot;O my people (I fear) lest your opposition to me should bring you the like of what befell the people of Noah or Hud or Saleh; and the people of Lot are not distant from you."/>
		<aya index="90" text="&quot;Beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him. Indeed my Lord is compassionate and loving.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="91" text="They said: &quot;O Shu'aib, much of what you say is meaningless to us, and then (for sure) you are powerless among us. But for your clan we would have stoned you to death. You have no power over us."/>
		<aya index="92" text="He said: &quot;My clan seems mightier to you than God whom you neglect and push behind your backs. Surely what you do is within the power of my Lord."/>
		<aya index="93" text="Do on your part what you can, O people, I will do what I will. You will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame, and who is the liar. So watch; I am watching with you.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="94" text="And when Our word came to pass, We rescued Shu'aib and those who believed, with him, by Our grace, but those who were wicked were seized by a punishment from heaven, and lay overturned in their homes in the morning."/>
		<aya index="95" text="As though they had not dwelt there at all. Beware! Condemmed were the people of Midian as those of Thamud had been before them!"/>
		<aya index="96" text="We sent Moses with Our signs and full authority"/>
		<aya index="97" text="To the Pharaoh and his nobles, but they followed the bidding of Pharaoh, though the bidding of Pharaoh was unrightful."/>
		<aya index="98" text="He shall be at the head of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and drive them into Hell like cattle driven to water -- what an evil watering-place to reach!"/>
		<aya index="99" text="Damned will they be in this world, and on the Day of Doom how evil the gift that they will receive!"/>
		<aya index="100" text="These are a few accounts of settlements that We narrate to you. Some still survive, and some have been mowed down."/>
		<aya index="101" text="We did not wrong them; they wronged themselves. When your Lord's chastisement descended upon them, their gods, on whom they called apart from God, were not of the least avail, and all they did was only to add to their destruction."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes human settlements in the acts of wickedness. Surely His hold is grievous and terrible."/>
		<aya index="103" text="In this surely is a sign for him who fears the torment of the Hereafter, the day when mankind will be assembled together, which will be a day when all things would become evident."/>
		<aya index="104" text="We are deferring it only for a time ordained."/>
		<aya index="105" text="The day it comes no soul will dare say a word but by His leave; and some will be wretched, some will be blessed."/>

		<aya index="107" text="Where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth endure, unless your Lord will otherwise. Verily your Lord does as He wills."/>
		<aya index="108" text="Those who are blessed will be in Paradise, where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth survive, unless your Lord wills otherwise: This will be a gift uninterrupted."/>
		<aya index="109" text="So, you should not entertain any doubt about those whom they worship: They only worship what their fathers had worshipped before them. We shall verily give them their meed without diminution."/>
		<aya index="110" text="Verily We gave to Moses the Book, but there was disagreement about it. Had the decree of your Lord (delaying it) not been issued the matter would have been settled between them. They are still suspicious of it and in doubt."/>
		<aya index="111" text="Surely your Lord will reward everyone in accordance with his deeds. He is certainly aware of all they do."/>
		<aya index="112" text="So, you and those who turned to God with you, should walk along the straight path as you have been commanded, and do not transgress, for He verily sees whatsoever you do."/>
		<aya index="113" text="Do not lean towards the wicked, or you will be caught in the flames of Hell, and have none to befriend you other than God, nor will you be given help."/>
		<aya index="114" text="Stand up for the service of prayer at the two ends of day and the first watch of night. Remember that good deeds nullify the bad. This is a reminder for those who are observant."/>

		<aya index="116" text="If only there had been men endued with virtue in the ages before you, who could preserve men from doing evil in the world, other than the few We saved from among them. Those who were wicked followed that which made them dissolute, and became sinners."/>
		<aya index="117" text="Your Lord would not surely destroy unjustly human habitations so long as the people are righteous."/>

		<aya index="42" text="And his vines were overtaken (with disaster), and he began to wring his hands (at the loss) of what he had spent on them, for the vines had fallen upon their trellises; and he said: &quot;Would to God that I had not associated any one with my Lord.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="43" text="He had no body to help him other than God, nor was he able to save himself."/>
		<aya index="44" text="The jurisdiction in this province belongs to God. His is the best reward, and His the best requital."/>
		<aya index="45" text="Present to them the example of the life of this world so like the water We send down from the skies that mingles with the earth to nourish its vegetation, which then on the morrow turns to stubble and is blown away by the wind. God has power over everything."/>

Then you will see the sinners terrified at its contents, and say: &quot;Alas, what a written revelation this, which has not left unaccounted the smallest or the greatest thing!&quot; They will find in it whatsoever they had done. Your Lord does not wrong any one."/>
		<aya index="50" text="When We said to the angels: &quot;Bow before Adam in adoration,&quot; they all bowed but Iblis. He was one of the jinni and rebelled against his Lord's command. And yet you take him and his offspring as your friends instead of Me, even though they are your enemies. How sad a substitute for the evil-doers!"/>
		<aya index="51" text="I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation. I would not take as helpers those who lead (men) astray."/>
		<aya index="52" text="The day He will say: &quot;Call those you had called My compeers,&quot; they will call them, but will get no response, and We shall place a gulf between them."/>

		<aya index="54" text="We have explained in various ways all things to men in this Qur'an; but of all things man is most contentious."/>
		<aya index="55" text="There is nothing to prevent men from believing when the guidance has come to them, and asking for their Lord's forgiveness, unless they want the example of earlier people visited upon them, or the punishment to appear right before their eyes."/>
		<aya index="56" text="We never send apostles but to convey happy tidings, and to warn. But those who disbelieve contend with false arguments to nullify the truth. They make a mockery of My revelations and of what they had been warned."/>
		<aya index="57" text="Who is more unjust than he who, on being reminded of his Lord's revelations, turns away from them, and forgets the evil deeds he had committed in the past. Verily We have placed a covering on their hearts so that they do not understand, and a deafness in their ears so that however you may call them to guidance they will never be guided aright."/>
		<aya index="58" text="But your Lord is forgiving, full of benevolence. If He had pleased to punish them for their doings He would have punished them immediately. But a term is fixed for them from which they will find no escape."/>
		<aya index="59" text="As for these habitations, We destroyed them only when they transgressed; even so We had fixed a time for their annihilation."/>
		<aya index="60" text="When Moses said to his servant (Joshua): &quot;I will not give up till I reach the confluence of two oceans, or I will journey on and on.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="61" text="When they reached the confluence they forgot the fish (they had brought as food) which swiftly made its way into the sea."/>
		<aya index="62" text="When they had gone past (the confluence), Moses said to his servant: &quot;Give me my breakfast. I am exhausted from this journey.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="63" text="He said: &quot;You see, I forgot the fish on the rock where we had stopped. Only Satan made me forget to mention this; but the wonder is the fish escaped to the sea.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="64" text="Moses said: &quot;But that is exactly what we were seeking.&quot; So they retraced their steps."/>
		<aya index="65" text="Then they found one of Our votaries, whom We had blessed and given knowledge from Us."/>
		<aya index="66" text="Moses said to him: &quot;May I attend upon you that you may instruct me in the knowledge you have been taught of the right way?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="67" text="He said: &quot;You will not be able to bear with me."/>
		<aya index="68" text="&quot;How can you bear that which is beyond your comprehension?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="69" text="&quot;You will find me patient if God wills,&quot; said Moses; &quot;and I will not disobey you in any thing.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="70" text="&quot;If you must follow me,&quot; he said, &quot;do not ask me any thing until I speak of it to you myself.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="71" text="So they set out till they (came to the quay) and went on board a ship in which he made a hole, (and Moses said:) &quot;You have made a hole in the boat to drown its passengers? You have done a strange thing!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="72" text="&quot;Did I not tell you,&quot; he replied, &quot;that you will not be able to bear with me?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="73" text="(Moses) said: &quot;Do not hold me for having forgotten, and do not reprove me and make my task difficult.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="74" text="The two went on till they came to a boy, whom he killed. Moses exclaimed: &quot;You have killed an innocent soul who had taken no life. You have done a most abominable thing!&quot;"/>
		<aya index="75" text="He said: &quot;Did I not tell you you will not be able to bear with me?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="76" text="Moses said: &quot;If I ask you any thing again then do not keep me with you. You have my apology.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="77" text="The two went on till they came upon some villagers, and asked the people for food, but they refused to entertain them. There they found a wall that was crumbling, which he repaired. Moses remarked: &quot;You could have demanded wages for it if you liked.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="78" text="&quot;This is the parting of our &quot;ways,&quot; he said. &quot;But I will now explain the things you could not bear:"/>
		<aya index="79" text="That boat belonged to poor people who used to toil on the sea. I damaged it because there was a king after them who used to seize every ship by force."/>
		<aya index="80" text="As for the boy, his parents were believers, but we feared that he would harass them with defiance and disbelief."/>
		<aya index="81" text="We hoped their Lord would give them a substitute better than him in virtue and goodness."/>
		<aya index="82" text="As for that wall, it belonged to two orphan boys of the city, and their treasure was buried under it. Their father was an upright man. So your Lord willed that on reaching the age of maturity they should dig out their treasure as a favour from their Lord. So, I did not do that of my own accord. This is the explanation of things you could not bear with patience.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="83" text="They ask you about Dhu'l-Qarnain."/>
		<aya index="84" text="Say: &quot;I will cite before you his commemoration.&quot; We gave him authority in the land and means of accomplishing every end."/>
		<aya index="85" text="So he followed a certain road"/>
		<aya index="86" text="Till he reached the point of the setting sun, and saw it set behind a muddy lake, and near it found a people. We said: &quot;O Dhu'l-Qarnain, you may either punish them or treat them with kindness.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="87" text="He said: &quot;I shall punish whosoever is wicked. He will then be sent back to his Lord who will inflict on him a terrible punishment."/>
		<aya index="88" text="But he who believes and does the right will have an excellent reward, and we shall make things easy for him.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="89" text="He then followed (another) road"/>
		<aya index="90" text="Till he reached the point of the rising sun, and saw it rise over a people for whom We had provided no shelter against it."/>
		<aya index="91" text="It was so, for We were fully informed about him."/>
		<aya index="92" text="He then followed (another) road"/>
		<aya index="93" text="Till he reached a place between two mountains, and found this side of it a people who understood but little of what was spoken."/>
		<aya index="94" text="They said: 'O Dhu'l-Qarnain, Gog and Magog are oppressing the land. May we pay you some tribute so that you could build a rampart between us and them?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="95" text="He said: &quot;The ability my Lord has given me is better. So help me with your manual labour; I will build a wall between you and them."/>
		<aya index="96" text="Bring me ingots of iron,&quot; (which they did) until the space between two mountain sides was filled up. &quot;Blow your bellows,&quot; he said; (and they blew) until it was red hot. &quot;Bring me molten brass,&quot; he said, &quot;that I may pour over it.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="97" text="Thus (Gog and Magog) could neither climb over it nor dig a hole through (the rampart)."/>
		<aya index="98" text="&quot;This is the benevolence of my Lord,&quot; he said; &quot;but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will reduce it to a mound of dust; and the promise of my Lord is true.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="99" text="We shall leave them on that day surging like waves pressing one against the other, and the trumpet blast will be sounded, when We shall gather them all together."/>
		<aya index="100" text="Then We shall bring Hell right before the infidels"/>
		<aya index="101" text="Whose eyes were veiled against My warning, and they could not hear."/>
		<aya index="102" text="Do the unbelievers think they can make My own creatures their protectors against Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospitality of infidels."/>
		<aya index="103" text="Say: &quot;Shall I tell you whose labour will be wasted?"/>
		<aya index="104" text="Theirs whose effort is misspent in pursuit of the pleasures of the world, even though they think they are doing good things.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="105" text="They are those who reject the signs of their Lord, and the meeting with Him. So their good deeds will be fruitless, and on the Day of Judgement We shall not appoint any weighing for them."/>
		<aya index="106" text="Their requital will be Hell, because they disbelieved and mocked My signs and messengers."/>
		<aya index="107" text="But surely those who believe and do the right will have gardens of Paradise as gift,"/>
		<aya index="108" text="Where they will abide for ever, never wanting a change."/>
		<aya index="109" text="Say: &quot;If the ocean turned to ink for writing down the colloquy of my Lord, the ocean itself would be exhausted ere the words (and wonders) of my Lord come to end, even if we brought another like it for replenishment.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="110" text="Say: &quot;I am only a man like you, but it has been communicated to me that your Lord is one and single God, and that whosoever hopes to meet his Lord should do what is right, and not associate any one in the worship of his Lord.&quot;"/>
