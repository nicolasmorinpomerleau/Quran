The surah describes the characteristics of these horses, their movements, and their breath to illustrate the nature of human actions and how they are judged by God. It highlights human neglect of divine blessings and ingratitude despite clear signs from God. The surah reminds that human actions, whether good or bad, will be examined and judged by God. It calls on believers to recognize divine blessings and prepare for judgment by leading a righteous and grateful life.
