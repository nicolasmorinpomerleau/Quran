        Surah At-Tawbah (The Repentance) is the ninth surah of the Quran, revealed in Medina.

It addresses topics related to the conduct of Muslims in times of conflict, managing alliances, and the importance of repentance. At-Tawbah highlights the necessity of sincerity in faith, commitment to religious obligations, and repentance for sins.
